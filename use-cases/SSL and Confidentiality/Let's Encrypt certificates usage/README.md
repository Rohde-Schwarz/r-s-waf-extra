Presentation
------------

Let's Encrypt is a CA (Certification Authority) that delivers free certificates using a simple and automated process. Certificates management is made with Certbot tool ( https://certbot.eff.org/ ) that we are going to use in an external way.

Certificates generated that way have a short lifetime (90 days).
* You can use WAF API to automate certificates update with certbot's results 
* You can configure a planned task of type **SSL Certificates expiration check** in the product.


|You will need to have Certbot installed on a device with an internet access.|
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Backup
------

You can download the backup file for the Sub-Workflow here: [SWF - Let's Encrypt Verification](./backup/SWF%20-%20Let's%20Encrypt%20Verification.backup).

Sub-Workflow
------------

This Sub-Workflow will be used to validate the verification made by Certbot to be sure that you own the domain name you are creating a certificate for. It consists in sending to Certbot the specific webpage it will ask for containg the appropriate hash.

### Setting up the Workflow

Add the **SWF - Let's Encrypt Verification** Sub-Workflow from the **Security** section. Add it right after **Start** node in your Workflow as shown below:

You can edit the **SWF - Let's Encrypt Verification** node and click on **OK** to validate default values. We will configure parameters later.

### Settings

![](./attachments/swf_settings.png)

* The field **Active** is a boolean allowing to activate and desactivate the Sub-Workflow. It should be set at **Yes** for the verification.
* The field **Hash** must contain the hash that will be set in the webpage requested by Certbot.
* The field **Filename** must contain the random part of the path generated by Certbot that it will ask for.

We will set the fields **Hash** and **Filename** later, after using Certbot to retrieve this information.

Certbot
-------

### Generate Hash and Filename for Certbot

From the device where Certbot is installed, enter the following command:

```
certbot certonly --manual
```

It will ask you to enter the domain name for your certificate.

Then, Certbot will show you an hash and a path, retrieve the hash and the filename indicated in the path.

### Edit **SWF - Let's Encrypt Verification** node

Go to the Workflow created ealier and edit **SWF - Let's Encrypt Verification** node, set the **Hash** and the **Filename** gathered before with Certbot in their respective fields. Check that the filed **Active** is set at **Yes**. 

**Save** the workflow and **apply** on the tunnel, the tunnel should listen on port 80. 

Before continuing and pressing **Enter** on Certbot, check that the URL provided by Certbot show the appropriate **Hash**. To do so, you need to access to the address provided by Certbot, the hash should appear on a blank page. Is it is the case, you can go back to Certbot and press **Enter**.

### Generate certificates

After pressing **Enter** Certbot will start verification, if it finds the hash at the provided address, ot will proceed to create certificates files. You can find these certificates files in `/etc/letsencrypt/archives/<domain-name>/`, in this example (`/etc/letsencrypt/archives/demo.example.org/`).

Import certificate in the WAF
-----------------------------

To import the certificate, connect to your box with the GUI, go to: **Setup > SSL > Certificates**. And press **Add**.

![](./attachments/add_cert.png)

You'll need to select files provided by Certbot:

* The file **privkey.pem** in **Key file**.
* The file **cert.pem** in **Crt file**.
* The file **chain.pem** in **Chain file**.

Configure certificate in the WAF
--------------------------------

Finally, edit your tunnel to add the certificate, go to the **SSL** tab and select the certificate in the field named **Proxy certificate (Server)**. **SSL Cypher Profile** has to be set at a value different from **\<None\>**
